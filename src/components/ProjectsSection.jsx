    description: "Secured 1st Place out of 109 teams in our debut national NLP competition by developing a highly efficient regression model. Our key innovation was a custom-designed hybrid TF-IDF architecture that was not only significantly more computationally and resource-efficient but also outperformed state-of-the-art models like IndoBERT in analyzing extremely noisy legal text.",

    description: "From raw battery data to a live predictive web app, this project delivers a complete, end-to-end solution for forecasting battery health and operational longevity. This project demonstrates the full machine learning lifecycle, from insightful data visualization in Power BI to model development and final deployment. We architected a solution to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteriesâ€”a crucial metric for industrial asset management. At the core of this project is a Random Forest Regressor, chosen for its robustness and precision, which has been trained on the Battery_RUL.csv dataset.",
